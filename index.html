        The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the
        Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[1] It allows
        documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[2]

        The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the
        public in 1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[3][4] Documents and other media
        content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web
        browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings
        called uniform resource locators (URLs).

        The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
        This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short
        programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs)
        which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of
        following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application
        software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with
        a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple
        websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website
        content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and
        comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.

        The Web has become the world's dominant information systems platform.[5][6][7][8] It is the primary tool that
        billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet

<!-- 이것이 주석이다 

html 은 Tag 를 통해서 사용하는 PGM 인데 생각보단 외우는게 많음
u -> underline 
h -> Head line 같은 의미로 단어의 크기를 조절하는거같음
b -> bold 굵게 만들어 사용하는거같음

br -> 엔터 치는 효과를 나타내는거같음 
p -> pharagrahp 단락을 나누는 효과임, 단락별로 쉽게 구분할수 있음  

html을 의미에 맞게 사용하는건 정말 중요한 문제임 
<h> vs CSS style 을 비교해보면 h가 더많이 검색 되는 상황임 
tag 에 대해서는 개인적으로 검색해보면 될것으로 보임 

img src 를 통해서 image를 저장함

"l로 끝나는건 list 의 약자임 ordered list(ol), unordered list (ul)"
목차를 나타내기 위해서 li 라는 리스트를 설정함 
ul 은 list 간의 구분을 위해서 사용함, ol 은 숫자를 붙혀서 사용함 

title 이라는 것을 사용하는 것이 좋아 보임 검색이 잘 되기 때문에

meta는 문서의 설정을 하는 방식 같아보임 brower 가 어떤 식으로 읽을지?

a tag 는 link 를 이용해서 만드는거다?
